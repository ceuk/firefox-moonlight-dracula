## Custom styling

The theme comes **as is** but it can be extended using CSS files provided in the custom folder. Further extensions should be included in the same folder to keep the main theme consistent.
To **enable** custom styles, copy and paste the following `@import` statements at the end of the `userChrome.css` file.

### Re-enable title bar controls (MIN-MAX-CLOSE buttons)

For Windows:

```css
@import "custom/_titlebar-controls-enable-windows.css";
```

For macOS:

```css
@import "custom/_titlebar-controls-enable-macos.css";
```

### Disable megabar behavior

```css
@import "custom/_megabar-disable.css";
```

### Add Developer Tools styling

Set theme to dark in Firefox Developer Tools [settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Settings). Then, add the following line to `userContent.css`:

```
@import "custom/_dev-tools.css";
```
